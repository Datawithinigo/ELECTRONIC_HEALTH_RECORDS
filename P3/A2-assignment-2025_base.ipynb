    "-   Just **one member of the team needs to submit the notebook** to the Moodle task. **The format of the delivery is `A2-assignment-groupID`**, using the group id assigned on Moodle.\n",
    "-   You can use **any function available for [MariaDB](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/built-in-functions/)** to perform any of the requested queries. It is your job, using the available documentation, to find the one that better fits the job to do.\n",
    "-   The R packages that you will need to use are defined at the beginning of the document. **YOU CANNOT ALTER OR USE ADDITIONAL PACKAGES NOT LISTED THERE**.\n",
    "-   For complex codes (more than a few lines), you must use **comments to explain your design decisions**.\n",
    "-   **Variable naming is an important part of programming**. Use meaningful names in order to increase readability.\n",
    "-   **Do not get stuck** on a given exercise. Most of the exercises are not incremental, just do the easy ones first.\n",

    "The **ejection fraction measures the volumetric fraction of fluid ejected from a chamber with each contraction**. As you may imagine, this metric is deeply connected with the heart functionality. Doctors typically measure the ejection fraction **using an echocardiogram**, which is an ultrasound imaging test that uses sound waves to create a picture of the heart. The test allows the doctor to see the size and shape of the heart and how well it is functioning. Doctors can measure both, the volume of blood in the left ventricle and in the right ventricle. In general, the **left ventricle is responsible for pumping oxygenated blood to the rest of the body**, while the right ventricle pumps blood to the lungs to be oxygenated.\n",
